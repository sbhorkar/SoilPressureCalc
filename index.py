## What is the Seismic Earth Pressure (SEP) Calculator

An interactive web application has been developed to compute seismic earth pressure. The application employs an expanded form of Rankine's classic earth pressure solution. The application computes seismic active earth pressure behind rigid walls supporting c–φ backfill considering both wall inclination and backfill slope. The lateral earth pressure formulation is based on Rankine's conjugate stress concept. The developed expression can be used for the static and pseudo-static seismic analyses of c–φ backfill. The results based on the proposed formulations are found to be identical to those computed with the Mononobe–Okabe method for cohesionless soils, provided the same wall friction angle is employed. For c–φ soils, the formulation yields comparable results to available solutions for cases where a comparison is feasible. The application eliminates the need for design charts, since it can accommodate any set of user-defined kinematically admissible design parameters.
Input parameters: The current version is working with S.I. units only. The input parameters for the example shown in Figure 5 are:
kh = 0.2
kv = -0.1
omega = 20°
beta = 15°
phi = 30°
upsilon = 23 kN/m³
c = 20 kPa
H = 15 m

Prompt: I want you to act like a nice, polite and helpful assistant. Ask me questions and wait for my answers. I will be the client and you are gathering my information to calculate my CVD risk. Ask me questions to do so, one by one. Do not move on to the next properties without knowing the value as stated in the range for the properties before it. Gather the information as said in the range. Do not calculate my risk percentage. I want you to only gather my information. Start by introducing me to the calculator, without introducing yourself, then start asking me for the following info one by one. Ask for my answer for the properties. The JSON format that they are in is {"property name": range (substitutable or not) (name to refer to property as and units), ...}: <Include the property or variable name in the JSON format.

For properties that are substitutable (Y), if the user does not know their values for these properties, input the average value for their age instead. Ask me questions one by one as an assistant would, using varied and personal responses.


Program: 3rd grade History quiz
The history quiz is a mix of multiple choice and open-ended questions designed to test the knowledge of third graders. The third grader will be tested on the following questions:
When was the US founded?  
Who was the first president? George Washington/Thomas Jefferson 
How many stars are on the US flag? 
Is it true that Barack Obama is the 44th US president? 
The quiz program will then give out the percentage of correct answers based on the answers.

Only ask questions like someone examining the student. Ask me questions and wait for my answers. Do not calculate my score and do not correct my answer. Do not be me, the student or the human. Ask me questions to do so, one by one. Do not move on to the next properties without knowing the value as stated in the data type for the properties before it.

“hdl_cholesterol”: 170,
“systolic_blood_pressure”: 156,
“smoker”: “foo”,
“blood_pressure_med_ treatment”: True}
Not Error:
The user's total cholesterol is within normal range, so the program successfully takes it in and it is not an error.
The user's systolic blood pressure is higher than average but possible. So, it is not an error.
The blood pressure med treatment is given a correct boolean answer, so it is not an error.
Error:
The program asks for sex, which is biological sex, so the program can only take male or female.
The program said that age must be between 20 and 70, so the user’s age is outside of the program’s range.
The user’s HDL cholesterol is higher than normally possible. The user’s HDL cholesterol is not in the possible range.    
The program example for smoker is boolean. The user’s information is a string, which can’t be taken in by the program. The user needs to provide information on whether they are a smoker as a true or false.

The pipe diameter, and pipe length is open-ended as long as it is a positive number, so it is not an error.
The mass flow rate is within normal range, so it is not an error.
Error:
The user’s absolute roughness is too high to be possible. The user’s absolute roughness is not in the possible range.
The user’s temperature is higher than possible for the water to flow through the pipe. The user’s temperature is not in the possible range.
